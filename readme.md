# TsÃºil

### WIP (Still not finished yet) (Though works enough to function)

Small system that you upload PDFs to so you have a central location to search through them all.


## Installation

### Manually
Make sure to have the following installed
 - `file`
 - `poppler`
 - `nim` (>=1.6.0)
 - `npm`

Then run `nimble install https://github.com/ire4ever1190/tsuil`. This installs
`tsuil` which you can run to start the server (runs on port 4356)

### Docker

**TODO**: Email me if this is critical

## FAQ

 - **Why Nim**: I like Nim
 - **Why react**: Need to learn it for uni course
 - **Do you like react**: its ok
 - **Is tsuil any good?**: no
 - **Why circle CI instead of github actions?**: See react
 - **Is it producton ready?**: Probably not, but I'm going to use it anyways
